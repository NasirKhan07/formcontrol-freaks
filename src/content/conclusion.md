## Wrapping up...

---

## Doesn't this just move the problem somewhere else?

---

## Why bother?
- On large-scale projects, the benefit will outweigh the cost
- A single reducer can be used for many forms
- Generic actions and validators can be re-used
- Set it up once, use it many times (even in other frameworks like NativeScript!)
