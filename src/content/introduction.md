Complex forms are a business requirement.

---

## The problem

- Many large forms means verbose, boilerplate code
- API changes are harder to deal with
- Bootstrapping form with existing data on the server

---

## Managing complexity with Redux

- Redux simplifies how we manage application state
- All state information is centralized in the store

---

Redux can do for form data what it's done for state.

---

## Forms with Redux
- Centralizes form data
- Template driven forms with FormBuilder validation
- Plays nice with your redux app
- Test and re-use the form reducer
- Pure JS functions for business rules
