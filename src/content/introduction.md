# FormControl Freaks: Redux Edition

# Rangle.io
### Daniel Figueiredo & Renee Vrantsidis

---

## Enterprises are adopting Angular.

---

## Enterprises love forms.

---

## Pain points
- Enterprises often require many long forms
- These forms sometimes have weird rules
- They cannot be template-driven, creating a lot of boilerplate
- If you're using Redux, integrating can be tricky

---

## Redux can power up your forms.

---

## Why?
- Moves your form setup out of the component
- Centralizes form data, easier abstraction on common operations
- Declarative and template-driven forms (with validation!)
- UX enhancements - form data in local storage
- Pure JS functions are testable, typable and extensible

---

### To demonstrate, we needed an example app with lots of forms...
